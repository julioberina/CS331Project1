# Project 1

This is a project for CS 331 that tests out the following methods for doing
matrix multiplication:

- Classical matrix multiplication
- Divide-and-conquer matrix multiplication
- Strassen's matrix multiplication

The algorithms will be tested with the same matrices of different sizes many
times for more accurate results. The test data will be n x n matrices of
varying size (n = 2, 4, 8, ..., largest size computer can handle).

The goal is to determine if one algorithm is faster than the other and if so,
determine whether the algorithm is faster in all, most, or certain cases.
